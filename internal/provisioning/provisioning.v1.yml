        A pubkey represents an SSH public portion of a key pair with name and body.
        If a pubkey was uploaded to one or more clouds, the deletion request will
        attempt to delete those SSH keys from all clouds. This means in order to delete
        a pubkey the account must have valid credentials to all cloud accounts the pubkey
        was uploaded to, otherwise the delete operation will fail and the pubkey will
        not be deleted from Provisioning database.
