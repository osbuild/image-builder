You will\nstill need to write factories in some cases, but your code will not\ndepend directly on them. Your code will be easier to change, unit test\nand reuse in other contexts.\n\nGuice embraces Java's type safe nature, especially when it comes to\nfeatures introduced in Java 5 such as generics and annotations. You\nmight think of Guice as filling in missing features for core\nJava. Ideally, the language itself would provide most of the same\nfeatures, but until such a language comes along, we have Guice.\n\nGuice helps you design better APIs, and the Guice API itself sets a\ngood example. Guice is not a kitchen sink. We justify each feature\nwith at least three use cases. When in doubt, we leave it out. We\nbuild general functionality which enables you to extend Guice rather\nthan adding every feature to the core framework.",

In December 2010 the\nLato family was published under the open-source Open Font License by his foundry\ntyPoland, with support from Google.\n\nWhen working on Lato, \u0141ukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially\nconflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite\n\"transparent\" when used in body text but would display some original treats when\nused in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the\nuppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same\ntime, he created a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato\nwas designed in 2010 - even though it does not follow any current trend.\n\nThe semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the\nstrong structure provides stability and seriousness. \"Male and female, serious\nbut friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,\" says \u0141ukasz.\n\nLato consists of nine weights (plus corresponding italics), including a\nbeautiful hairline style. It covers 2300+ glyphs per style and supports 100+\nLatin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA\nphonetics.",

The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP\nformat), and the default output is an encapsulated PostScript file (EPS).\nA typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data, such as company or\nuniversity logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting image is not \"jaggy\"\nlike a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered at any resolution.\n\nPotrace can currently produce the following output formats: EPS, PostScript,\nPDF, SVG (scalable vector graphics), Xfig, Gimppath, and PGM (for easy\nantialiasing). Additional backends might be added in the future.\n\nMkbitmap is a program distributed with Potrace which can be used to pre-process\nthe input for better tracing behavior on greyscale and color images.",
