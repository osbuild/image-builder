It is not based on the DISA STIG for RHEL9, because this one was not available at time of the release.  In addition to being applicable to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, DISA recognizes this configuration baseline as applicable to the operating system tier of Red Hat technologies that are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, such as:  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation and Desktop - Red Hat Enterprise Linux for HPC - Red Hat Storage - Red Hat Containers with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 image  Warning: The installation and use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) increases your attack vector and decreases your overall security posture.
